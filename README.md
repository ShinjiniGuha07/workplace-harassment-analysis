# Summary
Utilized ELSA's dataset to analyze workplace sexual harassment trends using NLP and hypothesis testing, uncovering high tolerance levels and low reporting instances. Explored training's impact on tolerance and reporting behavior, and identified significant implications on employee well-being and productivity. 


For the purpose of this analysis I utilized a dataset provided by ELSA. The data files are private and owned by the company and hence it is not available on the repository. I have also exclude the clean-up file for the same purpose
